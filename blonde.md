# Blonde-UIB-Final-Project

## Installing for development

You can easily install the latest version of the project by cloning the repository and coding it on VS Studio since it includes only the index html file, a single css file, and the md file that you are actually using.

## Git Hub Working Directory

For the further versions of the project, see https://github.com/ and make sure you have the latest version of the project by checking the dates on the commits. Please, realize that this is a work in progress and there is still a lot of work to be done.
