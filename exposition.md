# UIB Final Project Exposition

## Color Palette

White black, white and red?

This is a color palette based on the Netflix logotype color, the YouTube color palette and the merging brands of the 50's, mainly Coca-Cola.

## Hero Carousel

I choose to have an infinite animated carousel to give the user the idea of movies framing and movement, since these is a webpage of a movie star.

## Main Text Layouting

This is a grid-based layout. It was kind of hard to make it look as a magazine since the paragraphs had a different amount of text.

## Norma's page layouting

I used an embeded video of a very famous scene from "The Seven Year Itch" and put over it an SVG image with the original name of Marilyn: Norma. The idea was to suggest that on top of the character and the celebrity there was still the real person, something that reflects the approach of Blonde, the latest movie about Marilyn.

## Cards and form

This part of the page was a bit improvised but it still respects the concept of the page and  has some interesting animation of some of the more important movies of Norma Jeane.
