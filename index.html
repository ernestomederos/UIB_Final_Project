                As a young girl, Norma Jeane Mortenson grew up being raised by her mentally unstable mother Gladys.
                On her seventh birthday in 1933, she is given a framed picture of a man Gladys claims is her father.
                Later that night, a fire breaks out in the Hollywood Hills, and Gladys drives Norma Jeane up there,
                claiming that her father lives there, but is forced to go back home at the orders of the police. An
                enraged Gladys tries to drown Norma Jeane in the bathtub when she asks about her father but lets her
                go. Norma Jeane escapes to the house of her neighbor, Miss Flynn, who promises she will be fine. A
                few days later, Norma Jeane is sent to an orphanage while Gladys is admitted to a mental hospital,
                having been declared unfit to raise a child.

                <p>
                    While filming Some Like It Hot, Norma Jeane becomes more uncontrollable and mentally disturbed.
                    She
                    is overwhelmed by the constant press attention, feels that she is becoming a joke, has frequent
                    outbursts on set, especially toward director Billy Wilder, and grows increasingly distant from
                    Arthur. To cope with her stress, she begins taking pills.

                In the 1940s, Norma Jeane becomes a pin-up girl under the stage name of "Marilyn Monroe", appearing
                on magazine covers and calendars. While trying to break into the acting industry, she is raped by
                film studio president Mr. Z. In 1951, she auditions for the role of Nell in Don't Bother to Knock.
                The audition goes poorly after she breaks down and leaves in tears, but she impresses the casting
                director enough to give her the part. As her acting career steadily rises, she meets Charles "Cass"
                Chaplin Jr. and Edward G. "Eddy" Robinson Jr., with whom she begins a polyamorous relationship.
                Norma Jeane lands her breakout role in 1953 with Niagara, but after she is spotted in public with
                Cass and Eddy, she is told by her agent to limit her appearances with them in public, which upsets
                her because she feels that her persona of Marilyn is just a role and not her true self.

                Norma Jeane and Joe's marriage sours when Cass and Eddy give Joe some nude publicity pictures of
                her, which enrages Joe so much that he hits her and demands that she refuse to do The Seven Year
                Itch out of principle. However, she still goes through with filming, doing the famous publicity
                stunt with the white dress. When she gets home, a drunken Joe screams and gets physically violent
                with her. She divorces him shortly after.

                By 1962, she has become dependent on drugs and alcohol. Secret Service agents pick up an intoxicated
                Norma Jeane and take her to a hotel to meet the president, who forces her to fellate him, before
                raping her, and then has her taken away after she vomits in his bed. Already dazed and drugged on
                pills, she begins to wonder if this is what being 'Marilyn Monroe' has led to, and she also
                hallucinates having another abortion before being sent back to her home in Los Angeles. She learns
                from Eddy on the phone that Cass has died and has left something to her, which she refuses to see at
                first but is convinced by Eddy, who sends it in a package in the mail. Cass' memento turns out to be
                the stuffed tiger plush that she found when the three of them were together, and the package also
                contains a letter where he confesses that the letters that Norma Jeane has been receiving,
                supposedly from her father, were actually written by him.

                Norma Jeane becomes pregnant with Cass's child, much to her delight, but eventually decides to have
                an abortion out of fear that the child might inherit Gladys' mental issues. Cass supports her
                decision. On the day of the appointment, she changes her mind, but it is too late. Following the
                abortion, she breaks things off with Cass and Eddy. She later meets Joe DiMaggio, a retired athlete
                who sympathizes with her when she expresses her desire to leave Hollywood and become a more serious
                actress in New York City. As she films Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, she receives a letter from a man
                claiming to be her father. Norma Jeane feels disconnected from her onscreen performance at the
                film's premiere, saying it is not her. She returns to her hotel room, having been told that someone
                is waiting for her. Expecting it to be her father, she instead finds Joe, who asks to marry her,
                which she accepts reluctantly.

                In 1955, Norma Jeane auditions for the Broadway play Magda, written by renowned playwright Arthur
                Miller. During a read-through, her performance impresses everyone but Arthur. He eventually warms up
                to her when she gives him some insightful character analysis. Norma Jeane and Arthur marry and move
                to Maine, where she lives a happy life with him and becomes pregnant. However, when walking on the
                beach one day with a platter of food, she trips and miscarries. Distraught, she returns to acting
                soon after.

        <div class="text-history-1">

            <p class="image-p"> <span class="image-text">Marilyn Monroe (born Norma Jeane Mortenson; June 1,
                    1926 – August 4, 1962) was an American
                    actress.
                    Famous for playing comedic "blonde bombshell" characters, she became one of the most popular
                    sex
                    symbols
                    of the 1950s and early 1960s, as well as an emblem of the era's sexual revolution. She was a
                    top-billed
                    actress for a decade, and her films grossed $200 million (equivalent to $2 billion in 2021)
                    by
                    the time
                    of her death in 1962. Long after her death, Monroe remains a major icon of pop culture. In
                    1999,
                    the American Film Institute ranked her sixth on their list of the greatest female screen
                    legends
                    from
                    the Golden Age of Hollywood. In 2009, The Guardian named her one of the best actors never to
                    have
                    received an Academy Award nomination.</span></p>

        </div>
        <div class="text-history-2">

            <p class="image-p"> <span class="image-text">Born and raised in Los Angeles, Monroe spent most of her
                    childhood in foster homes and an
                    orphanage; she married at age sixteen. She was working in a factory during World War II when she
                    met a photographer from the First Motion Picture Unit and began a successful pin-up modeling
                    career, which led to short-lived film contracts with 20th Century Fox and Columbia Pictures.
                    After a series of minor film roles, she signed a new contract with Fox in late 1950. Over the
                    next two years, she became a popular actress with roles in several comedies, including As Young
                    as You Feel and Monkey Business, and in the dramas Clash by Night and Don't Bother to Knock. She
                    faced a scandal when it was revealed that she had posed for nude photographs prior to becoming a
                    star, but the story did not damage her career and instead resulted in increased interest in her
                    films.</span></p>

        </div>
        <div class="text-history-3">

            <p class="image-p"> <span class="image-text">By 1953, Monroe was one of the most marketable Hollywood stars;
                    she had leading roles in
                    the film
                    noir Niagara, which overtly relied on her sex appeal, and the comedies Gentlemen Prefer Blondes
                    and How to Marry a Millionaire, which established her star image as a "dumb blonde". The same
                    year, her nude images were used as the centerfold and on the cover of the first issue of
                    Playboy. She played a significant role in the creation and management of her public image
                    throughout her career, but she was disappointed when she was typecast and underpaid by the
                    studio. She was briefly suspended in early 1954 for refusing a film project but returned to star
                    in The Seven Year Itch (1955), one of the biggest box office successes of her career. </span></p>


        </div>
        <div class="text-history-4">


            <p class="image-p"> <span class="image-text">When the studio was still reluctant to change Monroe's
                    contract, she founded her own film
                    production company in 1954. She dedicated 1955 to building the company and began studying method
                    acting under Lee Strasberg at the Actors Studio. Later that year, Fox awarded her a new
                    contract, which gave her more control and a larger salary. Her subsequent roles included a
                    critically acclaimed performance in Bus Stop (1956) and her first independent production in The
                    Prince and the Showgirl (1957). She won a Golden Globe for Best Actress for her role in Some
                    Like It Hot (1959), a critical and commercial success. Her last completed film was the drama The
                    Misfits (1961).</span></p>
